Week 6: Practice Self-Compassion
This week, we’re getting personal. It’s time to reflect on your history with food and body image—and approach it with kindness.

Why This Matters:
You’ve been through a lot. Let’s honor your journey instead of beating yourself up.
Self-compassion builds resilience and helps you heal.
Your Practice for the Week:
Write a letter to your body. Reflect on your relationship with it over the years.
Practice speaking to yourself as you would to a close friend—especially on tough days.
Commit to one act of self-care this week that shows love to your body.
You deserve compassion, not criticism. Let’s make that shift.
