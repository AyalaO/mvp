Week 7: Letting Go
This week, it’s about clearing out the things that don’t serve you—both in your environment and your mindset.
Why This Matters:
Toxic influences make it harder to create change.
Letting go makes space for habits and people that uplift you.
Your Practice for the Week:
Identify one physical trigger (e.g., junk food at your desk, social media) and remove it.
Replace it with something positive (e.g., healthy snacks, inspiring content).
Reflect on habits or beliefs you’re ready to let go of.
Clear the clutter and create space for the good stuff.
