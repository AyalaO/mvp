Stick to 3–4 meals a day—no random snacking, no skipping meals.

**Why This Matters:**
- Keeps your energy steady (no more hangry moments).
- Helps you tune into real hunger cues instead of grazing out of habit.
- Builds a consistent rhythm for your body and mind.

**Rules:**
Plan Your Meals: Decide in advance when you’ll eat (e.g., breakfast at 8, lunch at 1, dinner at 7).
No Snacking Zone: Between meals, pause and ask, “Am I truly hungry, or just bored/stressed?”
Stick to It: Aim for 3–4 meals and pay attention to how this routine feels.
This isn’t about perfection—it’s about creating a rhythm that works for you. Keep it simple and consistent. Let’s go!
