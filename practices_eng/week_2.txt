Check your fullness level: Use a scale from 1 to 10. Aim for 5 or 6: Comfortably satisfied, no heaviness.

Keep practicing this at every meal. The magic happens when you pause and listen to what your body is telling you. Let’s nail this!

5. Satisfied: Perfectly full, no heaviness.
6. Comfy Full: You feel the food, still good.
7. Full: One more bite might be too much.
