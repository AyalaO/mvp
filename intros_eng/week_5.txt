Week 5: Fully Feel Your Emotions
This week, practice sitting with your emotions instead of turning to food for comfort.
Why This Matters:
Emotional eating often comes from avoiding uncomfortable feelings.
Allowing yourself to feel means you can address the real issue instead of numbing it with food.
Your Practice for the Week:
When a craving hits, pause and ask:
What am I feeling right now?
Is this physical hunger, or is it emotional?
Sit with the emotion. Let yourself fully feel it, even if it’s uncomfortable.
Write about it: What did you feel? What did you need in that moment?
Remember, no feeling lasts forever. You’re stronger than you think.
