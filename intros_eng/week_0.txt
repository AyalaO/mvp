Preparation Week: Find Your Real "Why"
This week, we’re setting the stage for success. Before you start building habits, let’s get clear on what you want—and why it truly matters to you.

Your Practice of the Week:
Write down a specific weight-loss goal (e.g., "I want to lose 15 kg").
Ask yourself “Why?” four times. Each time, dig deeper into your motivation until you reach the real reason behind your goal.
Share your final “Why” in the app—because we’re here to support you!
Example:
Goal: I want to lose 15 kg.
Why? To have more energy.
Why? So I can keep up with my kids (or be more active with friends).
Why? Because I don’t want to feel left out or exhausted doing things I enjoy.
Why? Because I want to feel fully present in my life, not held back by my body.
My Why: To feel fully present and engaged in my life.
