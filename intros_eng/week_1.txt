Week 1: Pause Before You Eat
This week, it’s all about mastering the art of stopping. Learning to pause and take three deep breaths before eating helps you:
Create space: Break the habit of eating on autopilot or out of emotion.
Be present: Slow down and focus on your meal instead of rushing through it.

Your Practice for the Week:
Before every meal or snack:
Pause: Take a moment before grabbing that fork.
Breathe:
Inhale deeply through your nose.
Exhale slowly through your mouth.
Repeat three times.
No need to pile on extra tasks this week. Just focus on pausing and breathing. That’s it! Let’s start building this habit, one breath at a time.
