Week 4: Identify Automatic Thoughts
This week, we’re focusing on the unhelpful stories you tell yourself about food and your body. You know the ones: “I can’t stick to this,” or “I’ll never look good enough.”
Why This Matters:
Recognizing these thoughts helps you stop them from running the show.
It creates space to reframe them into something helpful and kind.
Your Practice for the Week:
Notice Your Inner Voice: Pay attention to negative thoughts that pop up around eating or your body.
Write Them Down: Track them in a journal.
Challenge Them: Replace each one with a neutral or supportive thought (e.g., “I can make progress one step at a time”).
This is the first step to breaking free from old patterns. Let’s rewrite the script!
