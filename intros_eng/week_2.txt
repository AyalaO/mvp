Week 2: Notice Your Fullness
This week, it’s all about tuning into your body and recognizing when you’ve had enough. The goal? Stop eating when you’re about 70% full—before that heavy, regretful feeling kicks in.
While You’re Eating:
Check your fullness level: Use a scale from 1 to 10.
Aim for 5 or 6: Comfortably satisfied, no heaviness.

Keep practicing this at every meal. The magic happens when you pause and listen to what your body is telling you. Let’s nail this!
Fullness Scale (1–10):
1. Starving: Dizzy, empty, and cranky.
2. Ravenous: Shaky and ready to eat anything.
3. Hungry: It’s time to eat.
4. Peckish: Thinking about food but can wait.
5. Satisfied: Perfectly full, no heaviness.
6. Comfy Full: You feel the food, still good.
7. Full: One more bite might be too much.
8. Heavy: Uncomfortable, regret creeping in.
9. Stuffed: Too full to move.
10. Overstuffed: Pain, regret, and sweatpants needed.
