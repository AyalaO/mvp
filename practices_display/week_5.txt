Fully Feel Your Emotions. When a craving hits, pause and ask:

What am I feeling right now? Is this physical hunger, or is it emotional? 
Sit with the emotion. Let yourself fully feel it, even if it’s uncomfortable.
Emotional eating often comes from avoiding uncomfortable feelings.
Allowing yourself to feel means you can address the real issue instead of numbing it with food.

**Write about it:** 
- What did you feel? 
- What did you need in that moment?

Remember, no feeling lasts forever. You’re stronger than you think.
