Find Your Real "Why".

- Write down a specific weight-loss goal (e.g., "I want to lose 15 kg").
- Ask yourself "Why?" four times, digging deeper each time.
- Write down your final Why—this is your real motivation.

**Example:**
- Goal: I want to lose 15 kg.
- Why? To have more energy.
- Why? So I can keep up with my kids (or be more active with friends).
- Why? Because I don’t want to feel left out or exhausted doing things I enjoy.
- Why? Because I want to feel fully present in my life, not held back by my body.

My Why: To feel fully present and engaged in my life.

That’s it! Take your time with this—it’s a game-changer.
