Before every meal or snack, pause:
Take a moment before grabbing that fork.

**Breathe:**
- Inhale deeply through your nose.
- Exhale slowly through your mouth.
- Repeat three times.

No need to pile on extra tasks this week. Just focus on pausing and breathing. That’s it!
Let’s start building this habit, one breath at a time.
